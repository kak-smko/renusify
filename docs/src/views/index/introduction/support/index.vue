    <p class="body-1">
      The rapid growth of the web leads to extensive changes in languages and libraries. Renusify uses a minimal number
      of external libraries, which itself makes development easier.
    </p>
    <p class="body-1">
      With significant changes in different versions of libraries, we ensure that necessary updates are applied across
      the entire Renusify framework as quickly as possible. This ensures applications do not face security issues and
      that you can use the latest technologies in your projects.

      The Renusify framework is tested on several different devices, and efforts have been made to make it flawless and
      bug-free. However, in the world of programming, bugs can always exist. If you identify a bug, please inform us
